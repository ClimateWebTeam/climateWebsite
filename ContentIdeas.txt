Chapter 3 Ideas:

- The transport industry sector is currently the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.

The average CO2 intensity of a newly sold car rose from 121.1 to 124.5 gCO2/km in 2018, a 2.9% increase.
This was mainly caused by an increase in sales of larger vehicles, up to of 31% of new cars in 2018
from 21%, which alone contributed to a 1.8% increase in new car CO2 intensity.
The overall increase would have been 3.5%, if not for the increase market share of hybrid, plug-in hybrid
and electric vehicles.

Overall demand for car travel rose by 0.2% in 2018, a slower rise than in the previous four years.

- Government has not been clear enough as to how they will meet their target for all houses to be EPC band C
(moderately energy efficient) by 2035. (The current average is D).

Our target is for all new homes built from 2025 to be ultra-energy efficient and not connected to the gas
grid, instead relying on low-carbon heating.

- Afforestation rate in the UK, about 13,400 hectares/year in 2018/19, is still short of the Government's
ambition of 20,000 hectares/year. Scotland is the only nation within the UK performing strongly.

- Defra's Waste and Resource Strategy published in 2018 lays out several key targets for reducing waste in
England:

	- Work towards zero food waste going to landfill by 2030.
	- Increase recycling rates of municipal solid waste from around 45% to 65% by 2035.
	- Explore policies to work towrads eliminating the landfill of all biodegrable waste by 2035.

The Welsh Government's strategy on climate change, published in 2018, includes an ambition for zero-landfill
by 2025, and zero waste by 2050.

The Scottish Government's Climate Change Plan will be updated in 2020, following the Scottish Parliament's
legislation of Scotland's net-zero target.

- The target for net=zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050 became law on 27 June 2019, but a more effective
policy framework is required to drive extesnvie deployment of key technologies, in order to reach this
target.


Chapter 4 Ideas:

Between 2010 and 2017, the average cost of battery packs (Figure 4.2.b) fell much
 faster than expected, from 1,000 $/kWh down to less than 210 $/kWh. The international 
market for electric vehicles has grown by a multiple of over 20 since 2011, from less 
than 50,000 sales to over 1.2 million in 2017.

The variety of vehicles available and their electric range have steadily increased. 
In 2011 there were five fully electric vehicle models available in the UK with real-world 
ranges below 100 miles.67 By June 2017, the number of electric car and van models available 
in the UK had increased to 46, with real-world ranges reaching above 200 miles.
