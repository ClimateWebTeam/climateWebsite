	<!-- the report describes progress and necessary actions in several different areas, each area
	can be given its own section -->
	<section>
		<h1>Transport</h1>
		<p>The transport industry sector is currently the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions,
		and therefore must be a key concern of the country's effort going forward.</p>

		<p>The average CO2 intensity of a newly sold car rose from 121.1 to 124.5 gCO2/km in 2018,
		a 2.9% increase. This was mainly caused by an increase in sales of larger vehicles, up to of
		31% of new cars in 2018 from 21%, which alone contributed to a 1.8% increase in new car CO2
		intensity. The overall increase would have been 3.5%, if not for the increased market share
		of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles.</p>

		<p>Overall demand for car travel rose by 0.2% in 2018, a slower rise than in the previous four
		years.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Buildings</h1>
		<p>Government has not been clear enough as to how they will meet their target for all houses to
		be EPC band C (moderately energy efficient) by 2035. (The current average is D).</p>

		<p>Our target is for all new homes built from 2025 to be ultra-energy efficient and not connected
		to the gas grid, instead relying on low-carbon heating.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h1>Waste</h1>
		<p>Defra's Waste and Resource Strategy published in 2018 lays out several key targets for
		reducing waste in England:<p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Work towards zero food waste going to landfill by 2030.</li>
		<li>Increase recycling rates of municipal solid waste from around 45% to 65% by 2035.</li>
		<li>Explore policies to work towrads eliminating the landfill of all biodegrable waste by 2035.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>The Welsh Government's strategy on climate change, published in 2018, includes an ambition
		for zero-landfill by 2025, and zero waste by 2050.</p>
		
		<p>The Scottish Government's Climate Change Plan will be updated in 2020, following the Scottish 
		Parliament's legislation of SCotland's net-zero target.</p>
	</section>
	
	<!-- below section is essentially the conclusion of the page, could be emphasized from the rest
	of the text -->
	<section>
		<h1>So what now?</h1>
		
		<p>The target for net=zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050 became law on 27 June 2019, but a 
		more effective policy framework is required to drive extesnvie deployment of key
		technologies, in order to reach this target. </p>
