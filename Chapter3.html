				<h2>Transport</h2>
				<p>The transport industry sector is currently the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions,
				and therefore must be a key concern of the country's efforts going forward.</p>

				<p>The average CO<sup>2</sup> intensity of a newly sold car rose from 121.1 to 124.5
				gCO<sup>2</sup>/km in 2018, a 2.9% increase. This was mainly caused by an increase in sales
				of larger vehicles, up to of 31% of new cars in 2018 from 21%, which alone contributed to a
				1.8% increase in new car CO<sup>2</sup> intensity. The overall increase would have been
				3.5%, if not for the increased market share	of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles.</p>

				<p>Overall demand for car travel rose by 0.2% in 2018, a slower rise than in the previous four
				years.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="chapterText">
				<h2>Power</h2>
				<p>Efforts to source offshore winds have seen encouraging progress; in March 2019, the
				offshore wind sector deal stated an ambition to achieve 30 GW of offshore wind in the UK by 
				2030. Auctions are held every two years, offering visibility of future 
				Contracts-for-Difference rounds, the third of which commenced in May 2019.</p>
				
				<p>However, the Government has still not developed a route to market for onshore wind and
				solar, both low-cost forms of low-carbon generation which can make decarbonisation cheaper
				and quicker.</p>

				<h2>Waste</h2>
				<p>Defra's Waste and Resource Strategy published in 2018 lays out several key targets for
				reducing waste in England:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Work towards zero food waste going to landfill by 2030.</li>
				<li>Increase recycling rates of municipal solid waste from around 45% to 65% by 2035.</li>
				<li>Explore policies to work towrads eliminating the landfill of all biodegrable waste by 2035.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The Welsh Government's strategy on climate change, published in 2018, includes an ambition
				for zero-landfill by 2025 and zero waste by 2050.</p>
				
				<p>The Scottish Government's Climate Change Plan will be updated in 2020, following the Scottish 
				Parliament's legislation of Scotland's net-zero target.</p>

				<h2>Buildings</h2>
				<p>The current average EPC band for UK homes is D. Where possible (in
				regards to cost and	technical feasibility), all owner-occupied homes are required to meet
				EPC band C by 2040. The	Government has a target for all houses to be EPC band C (moderately 
				energy efficient) by 2035, but they have not been clear enough as to how they will meet this 
				target.</p>

				<p>Our target is for all new homes built from 2025 to be ultra-energy
				efficient and not connected	to the gas grid, instead relying on low-carbon heating.</p>

				<h2><u>So what now?</u></h2>
				
				<p>The target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 became law on 27 June 2019, but 
				a more effective policy framework is required to drive extensive deployment of key
				technologies, in order to reach this target. </p>
			</section>
			
			<section class="chapterText">
				<h2>Agriculture</h2>
				<p>The overall afforestation rate in the UK, about 13,400 hectares/year in 2018/19, is still
				short of the Government's ambition of 20,000 hectares/year. Scotland is the only nation
				within the UK performing strongly with its afforestation efforts.</p>
