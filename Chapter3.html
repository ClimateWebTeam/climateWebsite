	<h2 class="Chaptertitle"> Summary Of the Chapter </h2>


	<div class="paragraphs card-2">This chapter will focus on progress made against our indicators for measures to
		reduce emissions and implementation of policies to drive future reductions. Future emissions reductions depend
		on policies and actions taken now; the current target is an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050,
		but adopting a net-zero target will require further reductions.
		The target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 became law on 27 June 2019, but
		a more effective policy framework is required to drive extensive deployment of key
		technologies, in order to reach this target.<p class="paras"> </p>

				<section class="chapterText">
					<h2>Actions to Reduce Emissions</h2>
					<p>We use several indicators to judge the progress being made towards meeting carbon budgets and the
						2050 target (although these will need to be revised to align to the new net-zero target for
						2050).
						Currently, just seven our of our 24 2018 indicators are on track, consisting mainly of
						indicators
						concerning power and industry sectors.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>The areas of transport, buildings, agriculture and land use has shown a lack of progress in
							deploying emissions reduction measures, and thus are not on track in regards to almost all
							of
							our indicators concerning these area.
						</li>
						<li>The power sector has shown good progress. We believe this is the result of strong policy,
							which
							has incentivised renewable power generation and driven down cost in doing so, and pushed
							coal
							to the margins of the electricity system through carbon pricing. This represents a
							significant
							success, which we hope can be replicated in other sectors in the future.
						</li>
						<li>High-level progress in industry has been encouraging, however it is unclear whether this is
							due
							to action within policy or wider shifts in technology and the economy.
						</li>

					<h2>The Net-zero Challenge: what is needed from policy now</h2>
					<p>In May 2019, the Committee recommended that the UK set a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target
						for 2050. The Government and Parliament accepted this advice and on 27 June 2019 the target
						became law.
					</p>

					<p>This target is achievable with known technologies, alongside improvements in people's lives, and
						within the expected economic cost that Parliament accepted when it legislated the existing 2050
						target for an 80% reduction from 1990.</p>

					<p>Extensive changes, however, will be required across the economy, with complete switchovers of
						several parts of the UK capital stock to low-carbon technologies and development of new
						industries for carbon capture and storage and low-carbon hydrogen production. Major
						infrastructure decisions need to be made in the near future and quickly implemented, and the
						public
						will need to be engaged in making the required changes.</p>

					<h3>Urgency in plans</h3>
					<p>There is a need for increased ambitions in several areas:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>2040 is too late for the pase-out of petrol and diesel cars and vans.</li>
						<li>Over ten years after the Climate Change Act was passed, there is still no serious plan for
							decarbonising UK heating systems or improving the efficiency of the housing stock, while no
							large-scale trials have begun for either heat pumps or hydrogen. The low-carbon skills gap
							has yet to be addressed. </li>
						<li>Carbon capture and storage has not yet been started. Global progress has admitted been slow,
							but nevertheless there are now 43 large-scale projects operating or under development around
							the world.</li>
						<li>Afforestation targets for 20,000 hectares/year across the UK nations (due to increase to
							27,000 by 2025), are not being delivered, with less than 10,000 hectares planted annually on
							average over the last five years, although the strong increase in Scotland over the last
							year is encouraging. </li>
						<li>The voluntary approach that has been pursued so far for agriculture is not delivering
							reductions in emissions. </li>
						<li>There remains no route to market for onshore wind and solar PV, which are the lowestcost
							forms of low-carbon electricity generation and can contribute significantly to costeffective
							near-term decarbonisation. </li>

				<h3> Chapter 3: Part 2</h3>
				<section class="chapterText">
					<h2>Progress in Policy Development</h2>
					<p>In our June 2018 progress report we set out a range of actions required over 2019, to get on
						track to meeting the fourth and fifth carbon budgets and the 80% target for 2050. There has been
						disappointing overall progress however; only one of the 25 milestones has been fully delivered,
						and 10 have not even been partially delivered.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="chapterText">
					<h3>Transport</h3>
					<p>The transport industry sector is currently the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions,
						and therefore must be a key concern of the country's efforts going forward.</p>

					<p>The average CO<sup>2</sup> intensity of a newly sold car rose from 121.1 to 124.5
						gCO<sup>2</sup>/km in 2018, a 2.9% increase. This was mainly caused by an increase in sales
						of larger vehicles, up to of 31% of new cars in 2018 from 21%, which alone contributed to a
						1.8% increase in new car CO<sup>2</sup> intensity. The overall increase would have been
						3.5%, if not for the increased market share of hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles.</p>

					<p>Overall demand for car travel rose by 0.2% in 2018, a slower rise than in the previous four
						years.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="chapterText">
					<h3>Power</h3>
					<p>Efforts to source offshore winds have seen encouraging progress; in March 2019, the
						offshore wind sector deal stated an ambition to achieve 30 GW of offshore wind in the UK by
						2030. Auctions are held every two years, offering visibility of future
						Contracts-for-Difference rounds, the third of which commenced in May 2019.</p>

					<p>However, the Government has still not developed a route to market for onshore wind and
						solar, both low-cost forms of low-carbon generation which can make decarbonisation cheaper
						and quicker.</p>

				<section class="chapterText">
					<h3>Waste</h3>
					<p>Defra's Waste and Resource Strategy published in 2018 lays out several key targets for
						reducing waste in England:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Work towards zero food waste going to landfill by 2030.</li>
						<li>Increase recycling rates of municipal solid waste from around 45% to 65% by 2035.</li>
						<li>Explore policies to work towrads eliminating the landfill of all biodegrable waste by 2035.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>The Welsh Government's strategy on climate change, published in 2018, includes an ambition
						for zero-landfill by 2025 and zero waste by 2050.</p>

					<p>The Scottish Government's Climate Change Plan will be updated in 2020, following the Scottish
						Parliament's legislation of Scotland's net-zero target.</p>
				</section>
				<section class="chapterText">
					<h3>Buildings</h3>
					<p>The current average EPC band for UK homes is D. Where possible (in
						regards to cost and technical feasibility), all owner-occupied homes are required to meet
						EPC band C by 2040. The Government has a target for all houses to be EPC band C (moderately
						energy efficient) by 2035, but they have not been clear enough as to how they will meet this
						target.</p>

					<p>Our target is for all new homes built from 2025 to be ultra-energy
						efficient and not connected to the gas grid, instead relying on low-carbon heating.</p>
				</section>

				<section class="chapterText">
					<h3>Agriculture</h3>
					<p>The overall afforestation rate in the UK, about 13,400 hectares/year in 2018/19, is still
						short of the Government's ambition of 20,000 hectares/year. Scotland is the only nation
						within the UK performing strongly with its afforestation efforts.</p>
