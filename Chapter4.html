		<h2>The Net Carbon Account for the Second Carbon Budget</h2>
		<p>Final emissions figures indicate that the second carbon budget has been met by 384 MtCO 2 e.</p><ul><li>The second carbon budget was legislated at 2,782 MtCO 2 e.</li><li>The net carbon account for the second carbon budget period was 2,398 MtCO 2 e.</li><li>The budget was therefore met by 384 MtCO 2 e (around 14% of the budget).</li></ul>

		<h2>The Impact of Policies on Emissions Reduction Over the Second Carbon Budget</h2>
		<p>
Overall our policy indicators for 2017, the last year of the second carbon budget, suggest there was limited progress in most areas outside of the EU ETS.

<b>Transport : </b>

None of the current targets or regulations have been met for this catagory over the second carbon budget.

<b>Industry : </b>

The emmsisions target for this sector has mostly been met, however this is mostly due to a smaller growth in the sector than expectedin 2008.

<b>Buildings : </b>

Most hight-level indicators have not been met for this sector and insulation rates have fallen significantly.

<b>Power : </b>

Progress has definatly been made in this sector and lots of progress has been made in decarbonisingb electricity generation.

<b>Agriculture, Land Use and Forestry : </b>

None of the indicators have been met for this sector, possibly reflecting a lack of government policy in this area.

<b>Waste : </b>

Good progress was made in reducing waste emissions

<b>F-Gases : </b>

The F-Gas indicator was not met for the sector, this is most likely due to the policy only coming into effect in 2015.

		<h2>Assessment of Non-Policy Factors Underpinning the Seconds Carbon Budget Surplus</h2>
		<p>The key message from the study is that had the EU ETS cap and economic conditions turned out as originally expected, the second carbon budget would have been missed by around 65 MtCO 2 e, showing that policies did not deliver as much as planned. Overall, the results of the study are consistent with the Committee’s earlier analysis. They show that, without emissions reduction from the financial crisis and from accounting changes in the EU ETS, the second carbon budget would have been missed by over 2%. These findings support our previous conclusions that the surplus should not be carried forward as it is not due to policy being ahead of schedule.</p>
