     <div class="paragraphs card-2"><p class = "paras">Our mission at the CMP is to deliver a comprehensive look at the newly published CCC report.
	 Our aim is to inform the public about the changes to the environment in the UK and the EU and what is currently being done to improve the situation and what is being neglected. 
	 We hope to create an informative website that will allow our users to view the data in the CCC report impartially. We have condensed the 4 Chapters of the report into 4 simple and intuitive web pages for you to view. 
	 We provide information about Chapter 1: Progress in Reducing Emissions and what steps have been made globally to demonstrate a reduction of carbon emissions. In Chapter 2: Developments in International and European Circumstances
	 we cover the changes that have been implemented and how they are affecting the global population. In Chapter 3: Underlying Progress in the UK Towards Deep Emissions Reduction we take a deeper dive into the specifics of the 
	 UK and their Deep Emissions. Finally in Chapter 4: UK Performance in Reducing Emissions Over the Second Carbon Budget Period we explore the impacts of the Carbon Budget and the history of how countries have both exceeded and fallen behind the carbon budget.</p>
