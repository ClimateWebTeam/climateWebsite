	<h3 class="chapterIntro"> In this chapter we will review the performance in reducing emissions across the 
	economy as a whole, focusing on changes in annual greenhouse gas emissions since 
	1990, in the last five year and from 2017 – 2018 </h3>

	<h2> Introduction to reporting progress towards carbon budgets </h2>
	<p> In May 2019, in response to a request by the Governments, the committee advised 
	that now is the time to set a net-zero target for the UK, going beyond the existing 
	2050 target. The path to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will necessarily entail
	a steeper reduction in emissions over the intervening three decades. One average, 
	emissions will need to fall by 15 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e every year, equivalent to 3% of emissions 
	in 2018. </p>

	<h2> Economy-wide emissions trends for the UK </h2>	
	<p> <b>Actual Emissions</b> </p>
	<p> UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 2.3% in 2018 to 491 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e and have fallen 40%
	since 1990. Over the same period, the economy has grown by 75% (Figure 1.2). Adjusting for
	differences in temperatures between 2017 and 2018, the underlying change in total emissions in
	this latest year was slightly higher, a reduction of 3.1%.

	<p>Methodology changes to the UK emissions inventory are designed to increase the transparency,
	accuracy, consistency, comparability, and completeness of the inventory. There are three
	primary sources of uncertainty in the UK inventory:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Uncertainty in the current GHG inventory</li>
		<li>Uncertainty in Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) assigned to GHGs</li>
		<li>Uncertainty from other activities</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> <b>The net carbon account </b></p>
	
	<p> Under the Climate Change Act, performance against carbon budgets is not measured by actual
	emissions but by the 'net carbon account'. This account excludes emissions from international
	aviation and shipping, and allows for international trading of carbon allowances in sectors (i.e.
	power and industry) covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).
