		<h2>Introduction to reporting progress towards carbon budgets</h2>
		<p> In May 2019, in response to a request by the Governments, the committee advised 
		that now is the time to set a net-zero target for the UK, going beyond the existing 
		2050 target. The path to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 will necessarily entail
		a steeper reduction in emissions over the intervening three decades. One average, 
		emissions will need to fall by 15 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e every year, equivalent to 3% of emissions 
		in 2018. </p>

		<h2> Economy-wide emissions trends for the UK </h2>	
	<p> <b>Actual Emissions</b> </p>
	<p> UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 2.3% in 2018 to 491 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e and have fallen 40%
	since 1990. Over the same period, the economy has grown by 75%. Adjusting for
	differences in temperatures between 2017 and 2018, the underlying change in total emissions in
	this latest year was slightly higher, a reduction of 3.1%.
	</p>

	<p>Methodology changes to the UK emissions inventory are designed to increase the transparency,
	accuracy, consistency, comparability, and completeness of the inventory. There are three
	primary sources of uncertainty in the UK inventory:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Uncertainty in the current GHG inventory</li>
		<li>Uncertainty in Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) assigned to GHGs</li>
		<li>Uncertainty from other activities</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> <b>The net carbon account </b></p>
	
	<p> Under the Climate Change Act, performance against carbon budgets is not measured by actual
	emissions but by the 'net carbon account'. This account excludes emissions from international
	aviation and shipping, and allows for international trading of carbon allowances in sectors (i.e.
	power and industry) covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

	<h2> Sector-by-sector emissions trends for the UK </h2>
	<p> In 2018,6 for the fifth consecutive year, the sector with the largest percentage reduction in
		emissions was the power sector. Excluding the power sector, economy-wide
		progress was much less positive, with emissions falling by 1.0% on average (2.0% when
		temperature-adjusted). Reaching net-zero emissions in 2050 will require an average annual
		emissions reduction of around 15 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e (equivalent to 3% of 2018 emissions) across the economy:  </p>

		<li>Power Sector</li>

	<p> Emissions data for international transport and for sectors with large shares of non-CO2
	greenhouse gas emissions are produced with a one-year lag, so emissions in the following
	sectors are only available up to 2017: </p>

		<h2> Consumption-based accounting - the UK's carbon footprint </h2>
		<p> Emissions covered by the carbon budgets and the 2050 target are those released by activities
		occurring within the UK's borders only. This accounting approach is known as the 'territorial'
		basis. It is the standard accounting approach for measuring emissions internationally,
		as required by the UNFCCC. It avoids the risks that either some emissions are missed or the same block
		of emissionsd are counted. It also maps most closely to the levers available to th UK to reduce emissions.</p>	
		<p> Emissions can also be measured on a 'consumption' basis for which the allocation by country is based 
		on where goods and services (which lead to emissions during their production) are eventually consumed. 
		This is also known as the 'carbon footprint' of a country.  </p>

		<h2> Emissions trends for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland </h2>
		<p> <b>Scotland.</b> Emissions in Scotland fell by 3% in 2017 to 40.5 MtCO₂e, and were 47% below 1990
		levels. This fall was almost entirely driven by continued reductions in the power sector. There is
		now relatively little fossil-fuelled electricity generation operating in Scotland, meaning that the
		scope for further reductions in power sector emissions is limited.</p>
		<p> <b>Wales.</b> Emissions in Wales fell significantly in 2017, by 13% to 42.2 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e. Emissions were 25%
		below 1990 levels. </p>
		<p> <b>Northern Ireland.</b> Emissions in Northern Ireland fell by 3% to 20.3 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e, and were 17% below
		the 1990 baseline.</p>
