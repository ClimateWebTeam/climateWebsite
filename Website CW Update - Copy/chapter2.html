		<h2>Global and European greenhouse gas emission</h2>
		<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar annual decreases since 2011, 
		prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had been essentially flat since 1990. The energy intensity of the global economy only fractionally 
		improved in 2018, reducing 0.1%, a significantly smaller improvement than that seen in recent years. Improved energy intensity has been the dominant driver 
		of the slight decoupling between CO2 emissions and economic growth since 1990. However, the effect of global economic growth in 2018 (3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per year
		averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements. </p>

		<h2>Changes in the global energy system </h2>
		<p>Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018, its largest increase since 2010.34 China,
	    India and the USA together accounted for over two-thirds of the global increase. Large demands 
	    for heating and cooling due to weather effects contributed significantly to this large increase in 
	   energy demand (estimated to be around one-quarter of the annual growth).  Around 70% of this increase 
	    was met with fossil-based energy.</p>

       <p><b>Nuclear energy's</b> generation increased by 2.4% in 2018, but its share of electricity generation remained largely unchanged (10%) due to growing global electricity demand. 
        <b>Gas</b> was the energy source that grew the most in 2018, growing at the fastest rate since 2010. This indicates both the increasing demand for energy around the world and switching between coal and gas.</p>
	
	
	  <p>Oil consumption grew in 2018 increasing by 1.5% above 2017 levels. This was slightly slower than the 1.7% increase in 2017 (above 2016 levels), in part due to higher oil prices. Hydroelectricity contributes around 16% of 
	  global electricity generation, a fraction which has remained approximately constant over the last decade</p>

		<h2>Assessment of Non-Policy Factors Underpinning the Seconds Carbon Budget Surplus</h2>
		<p>The key message from the study is that had the EU ETS cap and economic conditions turned out as originally expected, the second carbon budget would have been missed by around 65 MtCO 2 e, showing that policies did not deliver as much as planned. Overall, the results of the study are consistent with the Committee’s earlier analysis. They show that, without emissions reduction from the financial crisis and from accounting changes in the EU ETS, the second carbon budget would have been missed by over 2%. These findings support our previous conclusions that the surplus should not be carried forward as it is not due to policy being ahead of schedule.</p>
