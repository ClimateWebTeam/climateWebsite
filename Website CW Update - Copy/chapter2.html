	 Advanced in international and European climate policy and Next Steps in International Climate Policy. Despite expanding capacity and falling 
	 costs for renewable energy, global emissions continued rising in 2018. The UK is one of several countries and regions to set a net-zero
	 emissions target in the last year, but overall international commitments to reduce emissions remain insufficient. </p>

		<h2>Global and European greenhouse gas emission</h2>
		<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar annual decreases since 2011, 
		prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had been essentially flat since 1990. The energy intensity of the global economy only fractionally 
		improved in 2018, reducing 0.1%, a significantly smaller improvement than that seen in recent years. Improved energy intensity has been the dominant driver 
		of the slight decoupling between CO2 emissions and economic growth since 1990. However, the effect of global economic growth in 2018 (3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per year
		averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements. </p>

		<li><b>China's</b>estimated CO2 emissions grew by around 2.2% in 2018.This increase was driven by emissions from the burning of coal,
		supplemented with increasing oil and gas consumption. </li>
		
		<li><b>The USA's</b>CO2 emissions increased 2.6% in 2018, driven in part by relatively large heating and cooling demands of a cold winter
		and warm summer along with strong economic growth.</li>
		
		<li><b>India's</b>CO2 emissions grew strongly at 7% in 2018, underpinned by strong economic growth. Although renewable energy deployment continues
		rapidly, it is being outstripped by energy demand growth. </li>
		
		<li><b>India's</b>emissions of CO2 decreased by about 2% in 2018 relative to 2017 levels, the first fall since 2014.The Rest of the World also increased CO2
		emissions in 2018 by 1.7% on 2017 levels.</li>

		<h2>Advanced in international and European climate policy </h2>
		<p>The 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018.
		The rulebook for the Paris Agreement was largely completed at COP24. This provides the internationally-agreed rules and processes to operationalise the Paris Agreement.  
		<b>Key features include:</b> Rules for harmonising future Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs - national commitments to emissions reductions prior to 2030), creating a common system for 
		expressing and comparing pledged mitigation commitments. The requirement for all Parties to submit biennial reports to allow monitoring of progress towards achieving their NDCs and other climate 
		obligations as part of the Paris Agreement Transparency Framework.  Common rules and obligations for the reporting of climate finance. Agreement on rules for international market-based mechanisms to share 
		mitigation efforts and accounted emissions reductions between countries could not be reached so will be returned to this year </p>

		<h3>Chapter 2: Part 2</h3>
	<section class = "chapterText">
		<h2>Changes in the global energy system </h2>
		<p>Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018, its largest increase since 2010.34 China,
	    India and the USA together accounted for over two-thirds of the global increase. Large demands 
	    for heating and cooling due to weather effects contributed significantly to this large increase in 
	   energy demand (estimated to be around one-quarter of the annual growth).  Around 70% of this increase 
	    was met with fossil-based energy.</p>

       <p><b>Nuclear energy's</b> generation increased by 2.4% in 2018, but its share of electricity generation remained largely unchanged (10%) due to growing global electricity demand. 
        <b>Gas</b> was the energy source that grew the most in 2018, growing at the fastest rate since 2010. This indicates both the increasing demand for energy around the world and switching between coal and gas.</p>
	
	
	  <p>Oil consumption grew in 2018 increasing by 1.5% above 2017 levels. This was slightly slower than the 1.7% increase in 2017 (above 2016 levels), in part due to higher oil prices. Hydroelectricity contributes around 16% of 
	  global electricity generation, a fraction which has remained approximately constant over the last decade</p>

		<h2>Next Steps in International Climate Policy </h2>
		<p>The UN Climate Action Summit, to be held in New York on 23 September 2019.
		This offers the first opportunity for countries to gather and signal their intentions for increasing NDC ambition. The UK is leading a focus area 
		on climate resilience at this summit. The publication of IPCC special reports on Climate Change and Land and The Ocean and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate
		in August and September 2019 respectively, which will inform negotiations at COP25. </p>
		
		<p>COP25 in Chile in December 2019, which will offer another opportunity for countries to communicate enhanced NDCs. It will have a particular focus on the effect of climate change on the oceans.
		COP26 (at the end of 2020), which is expected to be the major focus point for efforts to raise NDC ambition. It now appears probable that the UK will host the COP26 talks, having agreed a partnership bid with Italy.
        These are crucial talks and represent a major opportunity to increase global effort and ambition to cut emissions.The UK should use all the tools at its disposal to ensure that these talks are successful. 		</p>
