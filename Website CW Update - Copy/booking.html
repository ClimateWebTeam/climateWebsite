     <div class="paragraphs"><p class = "paras">Within this chapter you will come across the development in international and European 
	 circumstances over the past year. The chapter will cover Global and European greenhouse gas emission, Changes in the global energy system, 
	 Advanced in international and European climate policy and Next Steps in International Climate Policy. Despite expanding capacity and falling 
	 costs for renewable energy, global emissions continued rising in 2018. The UK is one of several countries and regions to set a net-zero
	 emissions target in the last year, but overall international commitments to reduce emissions remain insufficient. </p>
