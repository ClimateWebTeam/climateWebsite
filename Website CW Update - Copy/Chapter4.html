			<h1>Reducing Emissions Over The Second Carbon Budget Period</h1>

   </div>
   

    <h2 class="Chaptertitle" > Summary Of the Chapter </h2>
 
  
     <div class="paragraphs">After the end of a carbon budget the Committee is required to assess how the budget was or was not met, and the actions taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the budget period. The second carbon budget finished in 2017 and final data are now available. This Progress Report therefore assesses performance over that budget.  Overall, our assessment is that although the second carbon budget was met, this was primarily due to accounting changes in the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and the impact of the financial crisis, and not due to policy. Had the EU ETS cap and economic conditions been in line with original expectations, the budget would have been missed by more than 2%. <p class = "paras"> </p>

	<h2>The UK has benefitted from falling costs internationally of batteries and an expansion in the supply of electric vehicles (EVs):</h2> <p>Between 2010 and 2017, the average cost of battery packs fell much faster than expected, from 1,000 $/kWh down to less than 210 $/kWh. The international market for electric vehicles has grown by a multiple of over 20 since 2011, from less than 50,000 sales to over 1.2 million in 2017.66</p><p>The variety of vehicles available and their electric range have steadily increased. In 2011 there were five fully electric vehicle models available in the UK with real-world ranges below 100 miles.67 By June 2017, the number of electric car and van models available in the UK had increased to 46, with real-world ranges reaching above 200 miles.</p>

		<h2>The Impact of Policies on Emissions Reduction Over the Second Carbon Budget</h2>
		<p>
Overall our policy indicators for 2017, suggest there was limited progress in most areas outside of the EU ETS.

<b>Transport : </b>

None of the current targets or regulations have been met for this catagory.

<b>Industry : </b>

The emmsisions target for this sector has been met, however this is mostly due to a smaller growth in the sector than expected in 2008.

<b>Buildings : </b>

Most indicators have not been met for this sector and insulation rates have fallen.

<b>Power : </b>

Lots of progress has been made in decarbonising electricity.

<b>Agriculture, Land Use and Forestry : </b>

None of the indicators have been met, possibly reflecting a lack of government policy in this area.

<b>Waste : </b>

Good progress was made in reducing waste emissions

<b>F-Gases : </b>

The F-Gas indicator was not met, this is most likely due to the policy only coming into effect in 2015.

		<h2>Assessment of Non-Policy Factors Underpinning the Seconds Carbon Budget Surplus</h2>
		<p>The key message from the study is that had the EU ETS cap and economic conditions turned out as originally expected, the second carbon budget would have been missed by around 65 MtCO 2 e, showing that policies did not deliver as much as planned. Overall, the results of the study are consistent with the Committee’s earlier analysis. They show that, without emissions reduction from the financial crisis and from accounting changes in the EU ETS, the second carbon budget would have been missed by over 2%. These findings support our previous conclusions that the surplus should not be carried forward as it is not due to policy being ahead of schedule.</p>
