     <div class="paragraphs"><p class = "paras">Our mission at the CMP is to deliver a comprehensive look at the newly published CCC report.
	 Our aim is to inform the public about the changes to the environment in the UK and the EU and what is currently being done to improve the situation and what is being neglected. 
	 We hope to create an informative website that will allow our users to view the data in the CCC report impartially. We have condensed the 4 Chapters of the report into 4 simple and intuitive web pages for you to view. 
	 We provide information about Chapter 1: Progress in Reducing Emissions and what steps have been made globally to demonstrate a reduction of carbon emissions. In Chapter 2: Developments in International and European Circumstances
	 we cover the changes that have been implemented and how they are affecting the global population. In Chapter 3: Underlying Progress in the UK Towards Deep Emissions Reduction we take a deeper dive into the specifics of the 
	 UK and their Deep Emissions. Finally in Chapter 4: UK Performance in Reducing Emissions Over the Second Carbon Budget Period we explore the impacts of the Carbon Budget and the history of how countries have both exceeded and fallen behind the carbon budget.</p>

		<h2>Global and European greenhouse gas emission</h2>
		<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar annual decreases since 2011, 
		prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had been essentially flat since 1990. The energy intensity of the global economy only fractionally 
		improved in 2018, reducing 0.1%, a significantly smaller improvement than that seen in recent years. Improved energy intensity has been the dominant driver 
		of the slight decoupling between CO2 emissions and economic growth since 1990. However, the effect of global economic growth in 2018 (3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per year
		averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements. </p>

	<section class = "chapterText">
		<h2>Changes in the global energy system </h2>
		<p>Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018, its largest increase since 2010.34 China,
	    India and the USA together accounted for over two-thirds of the global increase. Large demands 
	    for heating and cooling due to weather effects contributed significantly to this large increase in 
	   energy demand (estimated to be around one-quarter of the annual growth).  Around 70% of this increase 
	    was met with fossil-based energy.</p>
