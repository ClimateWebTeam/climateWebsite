     <div class="paragraphs"><p class = "paras">Our mission at the CMP is to deliver a comprehensive look at the newly published CCC report.
	 Our aim is to inform the public about the changes to the environment in the UK and the EU and what is currently being done to improve the situation and what is being neglected. 
	 We hope to create an informative website that will allow our users to view the data in the CCC report impartially. We have condensed the 4 Chapters of the report into 4 simple and intuitive web pages for you to view. 
	 We provide information about Chapter 1: Progress in Reducing Emissions and what steps have been made globally to demonstrate a reduction of carbon emissions. In Chapter 2: Developments in International and European Circumstances
	 we cover the changes that have been implemented and how they are affecting the global population. In Chapter 3: Underlying Progress in the UK Towards Deep Emissions Reduction we take a deeper dive into the specifics of the 
	 UK and their Deep Emissions. Finally in Chapter 4: UK Performance in Reducing Emissions Over the Second Carbon Budget Period we explore the impacts of the Carbon Budget and the history of how countries have both exceeded and fallen behind the carbon budget.</p>

		<h2>Global and European greenhouse gas emission</h2>
		<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar annual decreases since 2011, 
		prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had been essentially flat since 1990. The energy intensity of the global economy only fractionally 
		improved in 2018, reducing 0.1%, a significantly smaller improvement than that seen in recent years. Improved energy intensity has been the dominant driver 
		of the slight decoupling between CO2 emissions and economic growth since 1990. However, the effect of global economic growth in 2018 (3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per year
		averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements. </p>

		<li><b>China's</b>estimated CO2 emissions grew by around 2.2% in 2018.This increase was driven by emissions from the burning of coal,
		supplemented with increasing oil and gas consumption. </li>
		
		<li><b>The USA's</b>CO2 emissions increased 2.6% in 2018, driven in part by relatively large heating and cooling demands of a cold winter
		and warm summer along with strong economic growth.</li>
		
		<li><b>India's</b>CO2 emissions grew strongly at 7% in 2018, underpinned by strong economic growth. Although renewable energy deployment continues
		rapidly, it is being outstripped by energy demand growth. </li>
		
		<li><b>India's</b>emissions of CO2 decreased by about 2% in 2018 relative to 2017 levels, the first fall since 2014.The Rest of the World also increased CO2
		emissions in 2018 by 1.7% on 2017 levels.</li>

		<h2>Advanced in international and European climate policy </h2>
		<p>The 24th Conference of Parties (COP24) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change was held in Katowice, Poland in December 2018.
		The rulebook for the Paris Agreement was largely completed at COP24. This provides the internationally-agreed rules and processes to operationalise the Paris Agreement.  
		<b>Key features include:</b> Rules for harmonising future Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs - national commitments to emissions reductions prior to 2030), creating a common system for 
		expressing and comparing pledged mitigation commitments. The requirement for all Parties to submit biennial reports to allow monitoring of progress towards achieving their NDCs and other climate 
		obligations as part of the Paris Agreement Transparency Framework.  Common rules and obligations for the reporting of climate finance. Agreement on rules for international market-based mechanisms to share 
		mitigation efforts and accounted emissions reductions between countries could not be reached so will be returned to this year </p>

		<h2>Changes in the global energy system </h2>
		<p>Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018, its largest increase since 2010.34 China,
	    India and the USA together accounted for over two-thirds of the global increase. Large demands 
	    for heating and cooling due to weather effects contributed significantly to this large increase in 
	   energy demand (estimated to be around one-quarter of the annual growth).  Around 70% of this increase 
	    was met with fossil-based energy.</p>
