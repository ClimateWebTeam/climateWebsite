	<h3 class="chapterIntro">Within this chapter you will come across the development in international and European 
	circumstances over the past year. The chapter will cover Global and European greenhouse gas emission, Changes 
	in the global energy system,advanced in international and European climate policy and Next Steps in International Climate Policy. </h3>

	<h2>Global and European greenhouse gas emissions </h2>
	
	<p>The carbon intensity of energy decreased 1% in 2018 relative to 2017. This follows similar annual 
	decreases since 2011, prior to which global average carbon intensity of energy had been essentially flat 
	since 1990. The energy intensity of the global economy only fractionally improved in 2018, reducing 0.1%, 
	a significantly smaller improvement than that seen in recent years. Improved energy intensity has been the 
	dominant driver of the slight decoupling between CO2 emissions and economic growth since 1990. However, the 
	effect of global economic growth in 2018(3%, slightly higher than 2.8% per year averaged over 2013 - 2017) more than offset these improvements.  </p>

		<li><b>China's</b> estimated CO2 emissions grew by around 2.2% in 2018.This increase was driven by emissions
		from the burning of coal, supplemented with increasing oil and gas consumption.</li>
		
		<li><b>The USA's</b> CO2 emissions increased 2.6% in 2018, driven in part by relatively large heating 
		and cooling demands of a cold winter and warm summer along with strong economic growth. </li>
		
		<li><b>India's</b> CO2 emissions grew strongly at 7% in 2018, underpinned by strong economic growth. Although 
		renewable energy deployment continues rapidly, it is being outstripped by energy demand growth. </li>
		<li><b>In the EU</b> emissions of CO2 decreased by about 2% in 2018 relative to 2017 levels, the first fall since 2014.
		The Rest of the World also increased CO2 emissions in 2018 by 1.7% on 2017 levels. </li>

	<h2>Changes in the global energy system  </h2>	

	<p>Global energy demand grew by 2.9% in 2018, its largest increase since 2010.34 China,
	India and the USA together accounted for over two-thirds of the global increase. Large demands 
	for heating and cooling due to weather effects contributed significantly to this large increase in 
	energy demand (estimated to be around one-quarter of the annual growth).  Around 70% of this increase 
	was met with fossil-based energy.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Nuclear energy's</b>generation increased by 2.4% in 2018, but its share of electricity generation
		remained largely unchanged (10%) due to growing global electricity demand. </li>
		<li><b>Gas</b> was the energy source that grew the most in 2018, growing at the fastest rate since 2010.
		This indicates both the increasing demand for energy around the world and switching between coal and gas.</li>
		<li><b>Oil</b> consumption grew in 2018 increasing by 1.5% above 2017 levels. This was slightly slower than the 1.7% 
		increase in 2017 (above 2016 levels), in part due to higher oil prices</li>
		<li><b>Hydroelectricity</b> contributes around 16% of global electricity generation, a fraction which has remained approximately
		constant over the last decade </li>
